# Word2Sense
This is the code base for our paper "Word2Sense: Sparse Interpretable Word Embeddings", accepted in 57th meeting of Association of Computational Linguistics (ACL 2019).

We have made minor changes in WarpLDA codebase, specifically in files Bigraph.cpp Bigraph.hpp and warplda.cpp files in src folder, to make warpLDA accept files in tsvd format.
